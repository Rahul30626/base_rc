Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine
Features of Node.js
1.All Node.js library APIs are asynchronous, i.e., non-blocking, asynchronous and event-driven. It simply means that a server based on Node.js never waits for an API to return results. After calling it, the server moves to the next API and a Node.js Events notification system allows the server to get a response from the previous API request.
2. Very fast
3. Single Threaded but Highly Scalable
4. No Buffering âˆ’ Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
